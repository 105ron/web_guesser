A simple introductory level Sinatra project creating a number guessing game. It:

* Generates a random number on startup
* Renders a web page where you can enter a guess
* Tell you whether your guess wasâ€¦  
  * Way too high
  * Too high
  * Correct
  * Too low
  * Way too low

This project is an introduction to using Ruby to generate web pages with ERB. This is a project for [TheOdinProject's](http://www.theodinproject.com) Rails track. See [here](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/sinatra-basics?ref=lc-pb) for more information.
